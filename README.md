# Cricket-Indonesia-U19

Welcome to this project.
This project is covering about performance comparison of Indonesia Girls U19 Cricket National Team facing qualifying round and the World Cup 2023 itself in South Africa.

The comparison data that will be used are total runs, batting strike rate, and bowling economy rate. The explanations of those data is as follows:
- Batting strike rate : ratio of total runs to number balls faced then times by 100
- Bowling economy rate : ratio of total runs conceded to total overs thrown (overs can be fraction)

In this project, the data is taken from cricclubs.com for qualification and cricinfo for World Cup.
For cricclubs.com, I can straight download from the site. Whereas for cricinfo.com,
I scrap the table using python with its code located at Scrap1.ipnyb.

After all the csv files are collected, these data are processed in PowerBI with its processing located at Processing Cricket.pbix.
The query is added with Crossing Names.xlsx for cross referencing the names that used between two websites.

Enjoy!
